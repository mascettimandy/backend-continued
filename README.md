# apollo-server

Created with CodeSandbox

#Start

# Next steps:

- I needed to update the backend as mentioned with creating an array to push into for the slug data. That way in the frontend I could map through to display on the UI.
- Time to study on mutation and how to persist data using it with GraphQL.
